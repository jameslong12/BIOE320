\section*{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To perform mass balances on O\textsubscript{2} and CO\textsubscript{2} during respiration.
	\item To calculate alveolar and pulmonary ventilation rates.
	\item To obtain a value for VO\textsubscript{2}, the volume of oxygen consumed at STP per 1 minute interval, at rest, after exercise, and during hyperventilation.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Background}
\subsection*{Dead Space}
Defined as the volume of gas that does not participate in gas exchange.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Anatomical dead space (~150 mL) results from the dead space in the conducting airways (trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles). The air in the conducting airways does not reach the alveoli and, as a result, does not participate in gas exchange.
	\item Alveolar dead space (very small in healthy subjects) results from poor perfusion to the alveoli. When blood perfusion is limited, some alveoli (even when they contain air) will not participate in gas exchange.
	\item Physiological dead space is the sum of the anatomical and alveolar dead space and it represents the volume of air that is inspired but does not participate in gas exchange with blood flowing through the lungs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Ventilation Rate}
Defined as the number of breaths in a given time:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pulmonary or minute ventilation rate represents the volume of air breathed in and out in one minute.
	\item Alveolar ventilation rate represents the volume of air that reaches the alveoli and is available for gas exchange in 1 minute.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Gas Exchange}
The goal of breathing is to provide a continuous supply of O\textsubscript{2} to the tissues and to constantly remove CO\textsubscript{2}. This gas exchange at both the pulmonary and the tissue capillary levels involves simple passive diffusion of O\textsubscript{2} and CO\textsubscript{2} down partial pressure gradients.\\

Atmospheric air is a mixture of gases (about 79\% nitrogen and 21\% oxygen, with almost negligible percentages of CO\textsubscript{2}, water vapor, other gases, and pollutants. Altogether, these gases exert a total atmospheric pressure of 760 mmHg at sea level. This total pressure is equal to the sum of the pressures that each gas in the mixture partially contributes. The pressure exerted by a particular gas is directly proportional to the percentage of that gas in the total air mixture. For example, the partial pressure (or the individual pressure exerted by a gas within a mixture of gases) of oxygen (P\textsubscript{O2}) in atmospheric air is normally 160 mmHg, whereas the atmospheric partial pressure of CO\textsubscript{2} (P\textsubscript{CO2}) is 0.03 mmHg. Since there is a difference in partial pressures between alveolar air and pulmonary capillary blood (e.g. P\textsubscript{O2, alveoli} > P\textsubscript{O2, blood}), gas will diffuse down its partial pressure gradient from the area of higher partial pressure to the area of lower partial pressure (Fig. \ref{partial}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../images/PF_II_1.jpg}
\caption{Gas exchange in the lungs}
\label{partial}
\end{figure}

In addition to partial pressure gradients, there are several factors that can influence the rate of gas transfer:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Surface area}: An increase in surface area of the alveolar membrane will result in an increased rate of transfer. Surface area remains fairly constant under resting conditions, but can change with exercise by increasing the number of pulmonary capillaries open (as a result of changes in cardiac output) and by expanding the alveoli as breathing becomes deeper. Pathological conditions, such as emphysema or lung collapse, can decrease the surface area.
	\item \textbf{Membrane thickness}: As the barrier separating the air and blood across the alveolar membrane increases, the rate of transfer will decrease. Thickness can increase the pathologic conditions such as pulmonary edema and pulmonary fibrosis.
	\item \textbf{Diffusion coefficient}: As the diffusion coefficient (solubility of the gas in the membrane) increases, the rate of transfer will increase. The diffusion coefficient for CO\textsubscript{2} is 20 times higher than that of O\textsubscript{2} offsetting the smaller P\textsubscript{CO2} gradient.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Test Procedure}
\subsubsection*{General Guidelines}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Before every trial, pump calibration syringe 15-20 times to flush the mixing chamber with ambient air.
	\item While recording, hold airflow apparatus very still parallel to floor. Make sure to keep the airflow transducer handle perpendicular to floor.
	\item Begin every recording with inhalation and end with exhalation. This will prevent receiving O\textsubscript{2} inspiration values less that that of total expiration.
	\item Record for a few second without breathing at the beginning of each experiment to ensure that the baselines are correct. Hit the vertical autoscale button, as needed, to confirm the magnitude of the baseline traces. If baseline values are not correct, stop and troubleshoot.
	\item Replace calibration syringe with AFT1 filter and AFT2 mouthpiece (Fig. \ref{syringe}).
