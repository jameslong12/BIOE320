A student wanted to test for statistical differences in the maximum oxygen consumption (VO\textsubscript{2}) of people with different activity levels. They collected VO\textsubscript{2} data immediately after vigorous exercise from 15 total healthy men between 20-29 years of age. The test subjects were divided into 3 groups: those averaging less than 2 hours of exercise per week, those averaging between 2 and 6 hours of exercise per week, and those averaging more than 6 hours of exercise per week. The resulting data can be found \href{https://jameslong12.github.io/BIOE320/Assignments.html}{here}. The VO\textsubscript{2} is reported in metabolic equivalents (METS, 3.5 mL O\textsubscript{2}/kilograms (kg) $\times$ minute). Conduct the necessary statistical test to discern the differences between the groups.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What type of ANOVA should be used? Be as specific as possible.
	\item Perform your indicated choice of ANOVA and report the F-statistic and p-value. State your conclusion(s) based on your calculations. Show and/or describe all work.
	\item Perform Tukey's HSD test on the data to determine individual differences between groups. State your conclusion(s) and show/describe all work.
	\item What is the difference between the conclusions drawn from your choice of ANOVA and the conclusions drawn from Tukey's HSD test?
\end{enumerate}
