\subsection*{Course Website}
The course website, which includes all necessary documents, is hosted on Github. You may access it through \href{https://jameslong12.github.io/BIOE320}{this link} or the following: \href{https://bit.ly/bioe320_s23}{bit.ly/bioe320\_s23}. Assignment submission and grading will be hosted on Canvas.

\subsection*{Course Description}
The primary objective of the laboratory course and selected assignments is to illustrate the physiological principles and processes that are described in BIOE 322, Systems Physiology. The material covered in the laboratory course should parallel (as well as possible) the material in the lecture course. Using the BIOPAC software and various medical measurements tools, you will conduct physiological tests including ECG, EEG, EMG, blood pressure, pulmonary function, etc. with your partner(s).

Graded material includes: pre-lab assignments, in-class worksheets, post-lab assignments and a review report.  There will be no quizzes or tests in this class. The pre-lab questions and post-lab questions are available on the course website. It is your responsibility to download and complete these assignments \textit{individually}. In-class assignments will be provided (one hard copy per group) at the beginning of the laboratory time.


\subsection*{Corequisite}
Students must be concurrently enrolled in BIOE 322. No exceptions.

\subsection*{Safety}
Laboratory environments include inherent dangers and thus strict compliance to safety measures is important. All students are expected to work safely and to ask for assistance when uncertain. Absolutely no eating, drinking or gum chewing will be allowed at any place or time in the lab.

\subsection*{Attendance Policy}
Students are required to attend ALL sessions of the laboratory. Exceptions for illness, family emergencies, or other excusable absences may be granted with instructor approval on a case-by-case basis. Any make-ups for valid absences must be done at the convenience of the instructor and your lab partner. Penalties will also be assessed for tardiness; the point deduction will scale with the severity of the infraction.

\subsection*{Grading Policy}

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
\begin{tabular}[h!]{cccc}
\toprule
	Category & Submissions & Total Points & \% Final Grade\\
	\midrule
	Pre-Labs & Canvas & 90 & 18\%\\
	In-Labs & In class & 270 & 54\%\\
	Post-Labs & Canvas & 90 & 18\%\\
	Review Paper & Canvas & 25 & 5\%\\
	Lab Conduct & In class & 25 & 5\%\\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Penalties of varying severity may be applied for lab safety violations, including but not limited to: improper use of equipment, leaving the lab area messy, endangering self or other students, and eating/drinking during lab.

\subsubsection*{Late Policy}
Late assignments will be penalized 30\% of the assignment value per day it is late, rounded up. In other words, if you submit a pre-lab one minute late on Canvas, you will automatically receive 30\% off the final grade. This penalty is intentionally steep - please turn in your assignments on time.

\subsubsection*{Regrade Policy}
If you believe that an error was made in grading your assignment, you should write a \underline{short} justification of your claim and email it to the instructor. The “statute of limitations” for submitting such claims is one week after the assignment was returned. Note that the entire assignment will be re-graded, not just the section in question, in order to ensure consistency and fairness.

\subsection*{Honor Code Policy}
Collaboration between group members is expected for the completion of high quality in-lab assignments. In contrast, you may not collaborate with other students, including those in your group, on pre-labs, post-labs, and the review paper. For these assignments, you are expected to turn in original work. Furthermore, for all assignments in this class, you may not consult the materials from previous years' BIOE 320 courses, including but not limited to: student assignments, reports, data calculations, and code. You may use academic sources, such as research papers, where appropriate, but you must cite these sources properly. Failure to cite work that is not your own is plagiarism and will be reported.

If you need clarification on any of these policies, please contact the instructor \textit{prior to submission} to avoid an infraction. For a list of standard definitions as outlined by the Honor Council, please see \href{https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/blogs.rice.edu/dist/c/490/files/2022/08/Honor-Council-Standard-Definitions-and-Policies.pdf}{this link}.

\subsection*{Commitment to Equitable Learning}
This class is committed to an equitable learning environment. Accommodations will be made for students with alternative needs, but it is critical that you alert the instructor in advance of any additional resources you need prior to assignment submission. For additional resources and more information, please visit the \href{https://drc.rice.edu/}{Disability Resource Center} and the \href{https://aop.rice.edu/}{Access and Opportunity portal.}

\subsection*{Schedule and Assignment List}
For assignments submitted through Canvas, the time of the due date is \textbf{midnight of the day before your scheduled lab date} unless otherwise noted. Please see the \href{https://registrar.rice.edu/calendars/spring-semester-2023}{Rice University Academic Calendar} for other important administrative dates.\\
